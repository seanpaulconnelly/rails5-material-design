## Rails 5 Material Design

This is a simple starter project that includes a badass Bootstrap 3.x Material Design theme running on Rails 5.

Clone, fire up puma, and navigate to localhost:3000/styleguide

Sample pages are all in html (not haml), but they're really just there for proof that all components etc work.
